#### Warning: App is in development state, don't use for critical production data

## Breaking change - docker-compose files names
To handle future upgrades for Postgres dependencies cleaner, original docker-compose.yml file will be removed.

If you have been already using Bloben with Postgres 13.*, you will have to start app with docker-compose-pg13.yml file.

For new users, it is recommended to use the latest Postgres 14.* with file docker-compose-pg14.yml.

Example:
``docker-compose -f docker-compose-pg13.yml up -d``

**Warning**: Using different Postgres version in docker-compose won't work without migrating your data.

For database upgrade refer to https://docs.bloben.com/docs/database-upgrade
